# TRIM 3D
TRIM 3D is a 3D version of the TRIM, which is a Monte-Carlo calculation program to follow the ion into the target, making detailed calculations of the energy transferred to every target atom collision. The calculation code is based on the TRIM codes in 1985. It can calculate any shape target materials and give the details of the collision and the final atom distribution. <br />
